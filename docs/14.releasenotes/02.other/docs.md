##### Enhancements
+ Add support for deploying the stand alone NeuVector scanner. This does not require a controller and must be deployed on the same host as the Jenkins installation. Docker must also be installed on the host. Currently, only the Linux version of Jenkins is supported (not container version). Also, add *jenkins* user to the *docker* group.

```
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
```
